1. Given a string, remove subsequent duplicate characters until we get a unique set of characters.
  Ex: input ==> apple ; expected output ==> ale Ex: input ==>appapple; expected output ==>le
    DeleteSubsequentDuplicateCharacters.class

2. A string will be given by the user.
    We have to check if the given string is Palindrome or not.
    Note: Palindrome means if the reverse of the string is equal to the original string.
    For e.g. Mom, Anna those are Palindrome String but Java is not a Palindrome String.
        ReverseStringEqualOriginalString.class

3.  How to get the 2nd greatest number in an array?
     Array = {2,33,9.50,80,100,200,100,9.50,210,100,210}
        SecondGreatestNumberArray.class
    
4. Print out the second last index from the array

5. Write a function in any language that will print "AN" if a number is divisible by 8, 
   "ANIM" if divisible by 16 and "ANIMAL" if divisible by 32.
         DivisibleNumber.class
   
6. Print numbers in rhombus shape 1 121 12321 121 1
   
6. Find a pair such that the product is maximum.

7. Check if first string is anagram of second

8. Find the sum of digits in a number traversing from back to front and vice versa of an array
      TraversingArray.class
   
9. Given a number find nearest palindrome.

10. Given an array of n length containing number 1 to 99 . print last 2 digit of result after multiplying all the n numbers in array.
        Last2DigitOfMultiplication.class
    
11. Parse a string, extract the number in that string, add 10% to that number than print the string with new value.
        AddTenPercentNumber.class
    
12. Given an array with numbers 1-5, how would you subtract one number from each index?
        SubtractFromEachIndex.class
    
13. Given an array with numbers 1-5, how would you subtract one number from every EVEN number in each index?
        SubtractFromEvenNumber
    
14. Write the program to find the consecutive duplicate letters in each word of the sentence and print the sentence without duplicate letters?
        DeleteSubsequentDuplicateCharacters.class {The code snippet is written at the end of the class}
    
15. Find the series of numbers in an array which gives the sum value as 3
        FactorialProblems.class
    
16. String sort,convert given two digit binary number to decimal number,eliminate continuously repeated letter in string(aaabcbb to bc)
        MoveZeroesToEndOfArray.class
    
17. Checking a given number in binary form - a palindrome or not.
    Given an integer ‘x’, write a Java function that returns true if binary representation of x is palindrome else return false.
    For example a numbers with binary representation as 10..01 is palindrome and number with binary representation as 10..00 is not palindrome.
    The idea is similar to checking a string is palindrome or not. We start from leftmost and rightmost bits and compare bits one by one. If we find a mismatch, then return false
            CheckBinaryNumberIsPalindrome.class
    
18. Parse a string, extract the number in that string, add 10% to that number than print the string with new value.Convert that string into integer then add 10% to that and store back new value for that string.
        AddTenPercentToString.class && RefactorCodeForAddTenPercentToString {This is adding ten percent to the String}
